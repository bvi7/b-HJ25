## Overview

This project demonstrates a reusable profile layout designed to display structured user or character information in a clean, organized interface. The layout emphasizes readability, responsiveness, and maintainable frontend architecture.

## Features

- Semantic HTML structure
- Tabbed content navigation using vanilla JavaScript
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Clean separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Easily extendable content sections

## Problem Solved

Profiles often contain large amounts of information that become difficult to read when presented in a single vertical layout. In this writing community, they required data to show off the stats of written characters and sections to display information at a quick glance. 

## Solution

Implemented a tab-based navigation system that segments content into logical sections that scroll upon reaching its maximum height, improving usability and reducing visual clutter without requiring page reloads.

## Tech Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling)

## Notes
