## Overview

This project demonstrates a reusable profile layout designed to display structured user or character information in a clean, organized interface. The layout emphasizes readability, responsiveness, and maintainable frontend architecture.

- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Clean separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
